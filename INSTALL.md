## Development Environment
Its super easy to set up our development environment

## Collect Pre-requisites
Install `python-pip`, `python-dev` and `virtualenvwrapper`
```bash
sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev
sudo -H pip install virtualenvwrapper
```
## Get the files
You can clone it directly from https://github.com/amfoss/website
```bash
git clone https://github.com/amfoss/meetup.git
```
## Setup development environment
First, some initialization steps. Most of this only needs to be done
one time. You will want to add the command to source
`/usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh` to your shell startup file
(`.bashrc` or `.zshrc`) changing the path to `virtualenvwrapper.sh`
depending on where it was installed by `pip`.
```bash
export WORKON_HOME=~/Envs
mkdir -p $WORKON_HOME
source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
```
Lets create a virtual environment for our project
```bash
mkvirtualenv --python=`which python3` meetup
workon meetup
```
## Install requirements
All the requirements are mentioned in the file `requirements.txt`.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Create local_settings.py
```bash
cp meetup/local_settings_sample.py meetup/local_settings.py
```
## Setup database
In the development phase, we use sqlite3.db
Setup tables in the DB
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```
Collect all the static files for fast serving
```bash
python manage.py collectstatic
```
## Create an admin account
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
## Run server
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
